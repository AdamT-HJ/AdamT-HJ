### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Adam Tung, a full-stack developer student currently studying with [Mission Ready HQ](https://www.missionreadyhq.com/)

Over the last 6 months I've been honing my skills working on frontend, backend, and full-stack projects with a foundation in JavaScript, React, and Node.JS, and a theme of AI/LLM integration.

Most recently, projects I've been working on include:
1. A cloud-based app. to recognise and categorise motor vehicles - MS Azure, Azure Custom Vision
2. An AI powered chatbot 'interviewer' for users to practice job interviews in any chosen professions with server saved and recallable 'sessions' - Gemini LLM API
3. An AI powered chatbot to provide advice on car insurance policies for users. - Gemini LLM API
4. A mock Service Station locator app, with service filtering and map integration.
